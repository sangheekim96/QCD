Description: This package contains functions that solve penalized 
    quantile regression problem through pathwise coordinate descent. 
    User choice of penalites are LASSO, SCAD, and MCP. 
    Codes for solving SCAD and MCP penalized quantile regression do not
    implement fast computing yet and will be added soon.
